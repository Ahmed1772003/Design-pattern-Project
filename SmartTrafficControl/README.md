# 🚦 Smart Traffic Control & Violation Management System

A **Java (Maven) desktop application** that simulates traffic signal control and detects traffic violations in a smart intersection environment.  
The project is designed mainly for **Software Design Patterns** practice, with a clean and modern UI built using **FlatLaf (Dark / Light)**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The system simulates real-time traffic flow using a **tick-based engine**, manages traffic lights using interchangeable control algorithms, and detects different types of traffic violations through a structured processing pipeline.

The project focuses on applying **object-oriented design principles** and implementing multiple **design patterns** in a practical and understandable way.

  - Emergency vehicle handling
- **Auto Run mode** (1 tick per second)
- **Add Vehicle tool**
  - Plate number
  - Speed
  - Stop-line crossing flag
  - Emergency vehicle flag
- **User Interface Enhancements**
  - FlatLaf **Dark & Light themes**
  - **Theme toggle** (Dark ↔ Light)
  - Toolbar **icons**
  - Table row coloring based on violation type
  - **Last Violation** badge displayed above the table

## 🧩 Design Patterns Used

### 1️⃣ Abstract Factory  
Used to create different intersection configurations dynamically.

**Classes:**
- `IntersectionFactory`
- `NormalIntersectionFactory`
- `HighwayIntersectionFactory`
- `SchoolZoneIntersectionFactory`

---

### 2️⃣ Bridge  
Separates the **TrafficLight abstraction** from the **control algorithm implementation**, allowing algorithms to change independently.

**Structure:**
- Abstraction: `TrafficLight`, `BasicTrafficLight`
- Implementation: `ControlAlgorithm`
- Algorithms: `FixedTimerAlgorithm`, `AdaptiveTrafficAlgorithm`

---

### 3️⃣ Chain of Responsibility  
Processes vehicle events step-by-step until a final violation decision is produced.

**Pipeline Components:**
- `LoggingHandler`
- `EmergencyVehicleHandler`
- `SpeedCheckHandler`
- `SignalViolationHandler`
- `FineCalculationHandler`

---

### 4️⃣ Singleton  
Provides a single global access point for managing and storing violations.

**Class:**
- `TrafficControlCenter`

---

### 5️⃣ Builder
Used to construct traffic scenarios in a clean and readable way.

**Class:**
- `TrafficScenario.Builder`

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Make sure **Java JDK 17+** is installed.
2. Open the project using **IntelliJ IDEA** or **NetBeans**.
3. Ensure **Maven** dependencies are loaded automatically.
4. Run the main class:
   ```
   src/main/Main.java
   ```
5. Use the toolbar to:
   - Add vehicles
   - Start Auto Run mode
   - Switch themes (Dark / Light)
